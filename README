SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION XXX
RATIONALE XXX
CONSTRUCTOR
    new() returns a new CPAN::Mini::Visit::Filtered object. Parameters to
    new() should be supplied as key=>value pairs. The following attributes
    are recognised.

ATTRIBUTES
    Attributes of the CPAN::Mini::Visit::Filtered class are all read-only:
    they can be set only when constructing an object. They all have getters,
    however, that can be used at any time, though its doubtful that you'll
    need to.

    CPAN::Mini::Visit::Filtered objects have the following attributes:

  action
    Once the archive has been unpacked, the coderef stored in action will be
    called. The subroutine will be passed a CPAN::DistnameInfo object.

    This parameter is mandatory.

  archive_types
    This is a regular expression that matches valid archives. The default
    value matches "*.tar.gz", "*.tgz", "*.tar.bz2" and "*.zip".

  cpan_base
    This is the base directory where the CPAN::Mini mirror is stored.

    This paramater is mandatory

  filter
    This coderef is called before any archive is unpacked. The intention is
    that this callback is used to filter out distributions you have no
    interest in.

    The subroutine will be passed a CPAN::DistnameInfo object and $_ will be
    set to the full path and filename of the file as stored in the
    CPAN::Mini mirror. The function should return a true value if you wish
    this archive to be processed further.

    By default all archives will be included. (With the possible exception
    of Acme::*. See include_acme.)

  include_acme
    Set this parameter to a true value if you wish to process the modules
    from the Acme::* namespace. Traditionally, these modules are all
    "jokes", and you may not wish to process them

    By default, the Acme distributions will not be included.

  unpack_dir
    The directory where the distributions will be unpacked.

    By default, a temporary directory (as determined by File::Temp::tempdir)
    will be allocated for you, and will be deleted when no longer required.

METHODS
  distinfo
  find_archives
  visit_distributions
